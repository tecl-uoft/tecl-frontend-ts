        Thank you for playing! We couldn't do our research without our
        participants, and we appreciate that you took the time to complete our
        study. An experimenter will review your audio and video recording, if
        the experiment was completed correctly, a $5 gift card will be sent to
        the email you have provided, within 2 weeks.

        Past research has shown that children are really exploratory and
        creative compared to adults, but we don’t know if this is always true!
        Today, you were shown a video before playing the game, but this was bad
        teaching – the solution didn’t work in the real game. We think that the
        way the video is presented will have a big effect and that children will
        explore less than adults when an adult teaches them (rather than another
        child)!

        If you signed up to be updated at the end of the study, we’ll make sure
        to let you know what we find! If you have any questions or comments,
        please reach out to{" "}
